# workshop-dihub

We are setting up a hands-on (no presentation) workshop on Aster
targeting data scientists.

The workshop will be held at
[di-hub](http://di-academy.com/event/aster-introduction-machine-learning-graph-unstructured/)


This is a set of sql queries using Freddie Mac Single family loan dataset.
Besides statistics on the data, we have implemented models like:
  * GLM
  * Kmeans
  * HMM
  * Naive Bayes

In the folder r_python_Aster, there is a set of examples of python and
r scripts that run in the Aster cluster. We use several ways to
connect to Aster, using RODBC, RJODBC and TeradataAsterR packages.

Authors:
  * Mark Oost
  * Mireia Alos Palop
